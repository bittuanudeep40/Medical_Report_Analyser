Medical Case Report
Patient ID: 987654
Name: Priya Sharma
Age: 58
Gender: Female
Date of Report: 2025-08-25

Chief Complaint:
For the past week, the patient has experienced intermittent episodes of chest tightness, fatigue, and radiating pain to her jaw. These symptoms are primarily triggered by physical exertion, like climbing stairs, and subside with rest. Today, she experienced a more severe episode while gardening that lasted 30 minutes and was accompanied by nausea.

Medical History:

Family History: Father died from a heart attack at age 55.

Personal Medical History:

Hypertension (High Blood Pressure): Diagnosed 10 years ago, managed with medication.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 5 years ago, managed with oral medication and diet.

Postmenopausal: For 8 years.

Lifestyle Factors: Sedentary office job, reports efforts to maintain a healthy diet but finds it challenging. Non-smoker.

Medications: Metformin (1000 mg daily), Lisinopril (10 mg daily).

Recent Lab and Diagnostic Results:

Electrocardiogram (ECG): Shows non-specific ST-segment depression in lateral leads (V5, V6); no signs of an acute ST-elevation MI.

Blood Tests: Initial cardiac troponin level is slightly elevated at 0.08 ng/mL (Reference range: <0.04 ng/mL).

Physical Examination Findings:

Vital Signs: Blood pressure 145/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, BMI 29.8.

Cardiovascular Exam: Normal heart sounds; no murmurs.

Respiratory Exam: Clear breath sounds.

## Diagnostic Assessment
Primary Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), likely Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) or Unstable Angina. ❤️‍🩹

This patient's presentation is highly suspicious for a cardiac event. The diagnosis is based on a combination of classic and atypical symptoms backed by clinical evidence.

Symptom Cluster: Her symptoms of chest tightness with exertion (angina), radiating jaw pain, fatigue, and nausea are highly indicative of myocardial ischemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle).

Clinical Evidence: The diagnosis is strongly supported by:

ECG Changes: Non-specific ST-segment depression suggests ischemia.

Elevated Troponins: A positive troponin level confirms damage to the heart muscle, differentiating an NSTEMI from unstable angina.

Risk Profile: She possesses multiple significant risk factors that make a cardiac cause extremely likely.

## Heart Attack Prediction Analysis
For an AI prediction model, this patient's data presents a high-probability case for a cardiovascular event.

Factors That Increase Cardiovascular Risk
These data points create a compelling picture of high imminent and long-term risk.

Age and Gender: A postmenopausal female (age 58) loses the protective effects of estrogen, significantly increasing her cardiac risk.

Positive Family History: Her father's early death from a heart attack is a major genetic risk factor.

Comorbidities: Both Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes are powerful contributors to the development of coronary artery disease.

Elevated Troponin: This is a direct biomarker of heart muscle injury.

Abnormal ECG: The presence of ST-segment depression is a sign of ongoing ischemia.

Elevated Blood Pressure: Her reading of 145/90 mmHg indicates her hypertension may not be optimally controlled.

High BMI: A BMI of 29.8 is in the overweight category, approaching obesity, which is another risk factor.

Sedentary Lifestyle: Lack of regular physical activity contributes to poor cardiovascular health.

Factors That Decrease Cardiovascular Risk (or are Negative for a Current Event)
This patient has very few mitigating factors.

Non-Smoker: This is her only major positive lifestyle factor.

## Recommendations
Immediate Hospital Admission: The patient requires urgent admission to a cardiac unit for continuous monitoring and management. 🏥

Cardiology Consultation: An urgent consultation with a cardiologist is necessary to guide further treatment.

Medical Management: Initiate standard ACS protocol, which may include antiplatelet therapy (e.g., Aspirin, Clopidogrel), anticoagulants (e.g., Heparin), beta-blockers, and nitrates. Her existing medications for diabetes and hypertension must also be managed.

Further Diagnostics: She will likely need a coronary angiography to visualize the coronary arteries and determine the extent and location of any blockages. Based on the findings, she may require an intervention like a stent (percutaneous coronary intervention) or bypass surgery.
