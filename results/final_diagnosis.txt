### Final Diagnosis:

* **Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's history of anxiety, family history of generalized anxiety disorder, and current symptoms of intense fear and impending doom suggest a potential anxiety disorder, possibly panic disorder, as stated in the Psychologist Report. The Cardiologist Report also mentions anxiety-related symptoms as a possible cause of the patient's chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath.
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The Cardiologist Report lists GERD as a possible cause of the patient's chest pain and discomfort, which may be exacerbated by stress and anxiety. The Pulmonologist Report also mentions potential GERD-related respiratory symptoms, such as cough and wheezing.
* **Cardiac Arrhythmia or Mitral Valve Prolapse**: The Cardiologist Report mentions cardiac arrhythmia and mitral valve prolapse as possible causes of the patient's palpitations and chest pain, with the Holter monitor results showing occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) that could be a sign of an underlying arrhythmia, and the possibility of a subtle mitral valve prolapse that may not have been detected on the echocardiogram.
